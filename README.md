Using Matplotlib to perform plotting and statistical data

##PROJECT - You've just joined Pymaceuticals, Inc., a new pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer medications. Recently, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.
As a senior data analyst at the company, you've been given access to the complete data from their most recent animal study. In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.
The executive team has tasked you with generating all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the clinical study. They have also asked you for a top-level summary of the study results.

#For this project, calculations/analysis is done not just with calculations but by generating various charts graphs and plots.  By generating statistical data in dataframes and mulitple merges on the drug regiens, test mice, timepoints and tumor mass/weight, we are able to make curent and future conclusions/assessments.

#I had some difficlty with some of the for loops, but with research into python calculations and options, especially on realpython.com, and lots of trial and error, I was able to get some nicely working code.

#Another source of difficulty that required lots of research was the boxplot.  Not sure why I have such a tough time with this concept.

#Finally, the regression line and aggregate took lots of referrals back to practiced 'solved' code to ensure proper code.

#Took some time to get it all set, but once it was all debugged and cleaned, I was able to get some good visuals for analysis.
